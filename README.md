# Barebones Web Server in FPC/Lazarus
Building a full-featured webserver for an htmx based web application needs a simple and manageable server codebase. This project is to showcase the simplicity of the developer experience of doing so in FPC/Lazarus and to highlight the cross-platform capabilities of FPC. The final binary is blazingly fast and can run efficently on a single-core, 1GB RAM virtual machine. 

This project has only been possible because of the dedication and persistance of the FPC/Lazarus team, the amazing micro-services framework for FPC [Brook Tardigrade](https://github.com/risoflora/brookframework), the cryptography library [Rhl](https://github.com/maciejkaczkowski/rhl).

## Requirements
[Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/)

Install the following packages in Lazarus in this order:
1. [Rhl](https://github.com/maciejkaczkowski/rhl)
2. [Brook Tardigrade](https://github.com/risoflora/brookframework). You will also need to install the dll/so for libsagui. Instructions are on their github page
3. [Sugar for FP/Lazarus](https://github.com/stanley643212/sugar). This gives you a lot of syntax sugar to quicky build html pages and serve.

 Documentation is coming soon.
